# LOFIGEN MAGENTA

Lofigen Magenta is a [Lofi Hip-Hop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lo-fi_hip_hop) generator made by Vincent Huynh.
It is in some ways a continuation of my previous project [Lofigen](https://github.com/vin-huynh/lofigen),
with the most major addition being the integration of machine learning models made by Google's Magenta.js to generate more natrual drum beats and melodies.
Other changes include jazzier 32-bar chord progressions, more fluid chord voicings, wider instrumentation options, and much more!
